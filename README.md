## About the Project
For nearly a century, the field of bankruptcy prediction has remained a prominent topic in economics. The objective is to create a predictive model integrating various econometric indicators, enabling us to anticipate a company's financial health. This prediction aids in evaluating a company's financial status and its long-term prospects in the market. It encompasses the analysis of businesses operating in Poland, spanning from 2000 to 2012 for bankrupt firms and focusing on those still in operation in 2007. The five classification cases are based on the forecasting period and include financial ratios from the initial year, accompanied by corresponding class labels indicating bankruptcy status.
